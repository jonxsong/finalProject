        <div id="missionStatement">
            <h2>MISSION STATEMENT</h2>
            <p>
                The NBA MVP award is exclusive to only the best of the best in the league.
                We wanted to see if we could constitute what the "best" actually means--or if
                there's a clear, cut candidate that stands above everyone else in terms of production.
                The MVP award is not just given to anyone, and we would like to see if our data would
                point us in the direction of a particular candidate, being either Lebron James or Giannis Antetokounmpo.
                However, due to the unforseen circumstances, the NBA season has been suspended indefinitely so the 
                current data we have now may not be representative of what the data would be in choosing the NBA MVP. The 
                race this year has been very close, but in our research we think the award is already skewed towards one person.
                So let's investigate further, shall we?

            <h2>What makes a league MVP?</h2>
            <p>
                The Most Valuable Player award by definition, is a player who exceeds the NBA league average for 
                every player statistic, and ultimately contributes most towards their team winning. So in recent years,
                the top-performing player on the team with the most wins is usually selected as the MVP. However, that is not always the case
                and that's where we can offer more insight.
